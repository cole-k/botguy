# botguy

botguy (Skype handle: `thebotguy`) is a Skype bot I've built for a Skype group chat that my friends and I use daily.

He does a lot of odd jobs (in both senses of the word), like allow users to commend each other by saying "nice one" ([niceone.js](/niceone.js)) or query and post to our - sigh - meme machine ([yam.js](/yam.js)), which I refuse to link to but you can find a link to in my code.

You probably are confused and maybe a little disgusted by botguy's existence. I don't blame you. However, what little capacity for shame I possessed was stripped from me when frugality took the reins (seeing as private repos would cost me).

botguy will continue to evolve until he either

1. Reaches completion (likelihood: 0-1%)
2. Is abandoned by me (likelihood: 10-20%)
3. Is abandoned when our group disintigrates or finally migrates to a better group chat platform not supported by Microsoft's botframework (likelihood: 0-10%)

If this repo looks dead, one of these three things probably happened, even though I gave each a relativley low chance.

I'll try to keep this readme updated with botguy's most salient features, though the most up-to-date description of what botguy does will likely be in the help file ([help.js](/help.js)).
